Application: Game
Application that plays the Hi-Lo guessing game. The program picks a random number between 1 and 100 (inclusive), and then prompts user to guess the number, warning the user that he/she has only five tries to guess the correct number. After each guess, the application will report to the user whether he/she is correct or that the guess was too high or too low. It will continue accepting guesses until the user guesses the number or makes five unsuccessful attempts. If the user guesses correctly, the application will print out a congratulatory message. If the user guesses five times unsuccessfully, it will print out a message telling the user the game is over. At the end of the game, it will prompt the user to indicate whether or not he/she wishes to play again.
